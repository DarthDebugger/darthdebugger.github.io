An inscription in the ancient and dusty code reads:

Welcome Web Adventurer! 

Welcome and a word of caution.  You can analyse this code and learn 
many of the secrets held within this precious and powerful Shard.
You may very well grow new skills in doing so and I would never discourage that
however,  be warned, this path may lead you to spoliers and in your attempt to 
seek knowldege and power, you may lose something else along the way. Heed this inscription 
or you may carry the same fate as so many before you...

Wise words? or the carvings of an old fool gone insane?  Perhaps both...

The inscrption becomes indecernable and trails off into gibberish about prime numbers found
in artistic works and lorem ipsum something ipsum. If a prime number is the sum of two squares, 
then it’s not a Gaussian prime. So when you note that 13 = 4+9, and that 89 = 25+64, you’re 
observing that 13 and 89 are not Gaussian primes. It’s easy to see when a prime is not Gaussian. 
It’s a whole lot harder to check that one is. In fact, a handful of unsolved problems such as Twin Primes, 
Goldbach Conjecture, Palindromic Primes, & The Riemann Hypothesis all revolve around this general 
unpredictability & uncertainty in prime numbers as they approach infinity. Granted, since the early days 
of Euclid we’ve found a handful algorithms that predict some placement, but general theorems haven’t been 
accepted nor did previous attempts have the tools to test large numbers. prime numbers in nature & in our lives 
are everywhere: cicadas time their life cycles by them, clock-makers use them to calculate ticks, 
& aeronautical engines use them to balance frequency of air pulses. Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply 
random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. 
Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the 
more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of 
the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 
1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. 
This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, 
"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.

The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. 
Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original 
form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.

 Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Vivamus ligula arcu, auctor at mollis eu, euismod id velit. 
 Donec suscipit mauris sit amet sem sollicitudin, et blandit nisi sagittis. Duis a sagittis justo, non lacinia urna. 
 Aenean eget eros rhoncus, lobortis velit vel, rhoncus nunc. Duis faucibus tellus in risus commodo, eu gravida augue 
 mollis. Fusce eu aliquam arcu. Ut condimentum dolor auctor nibh ultrices tristique. Maecenas efficitur turpis et tortor 
 accumsan, imperdiet fermentum dolor suscipit. Donec nec arcu augue. Nulla eget felis eget lectus congue porttitor ut ac 
 metus. Vestibulum est nibh, gravida in nulla sed, rutrum posuere magna. Praesent gravida id ipsum quis finibus.

Fusce sed diam iaculis magna eleifend consectetur vel nec ante. Praesent bibendum felis elit, in condimentum neque euismod 
vel. Phasellus et leo neque. Ut pulvinar tellus ut nulla porttitor malesuada. Mauris suscipit mauris vitae risus hendrerit 
convallis. Quisque porta tortor varius ultrices euismod. Phasellus libero eros, vestibulum eu faucibus et, gravida sed 
purus. Fusce mattis vulputate nibh, eu vestibulum neque tempor sed. Aliquam gravida arcu vel tellus varius facilisis. 
Mauris eget risus id nulla suscipit semper ut et arcu. Nulla id fermentum nulla. In sem magna, blandit ac nisi sit amet, 
porta sollicitudin mauris....  The inscription trails on but is too faint to read...

								<p>The Prismatic Shard is built upon the ATTiny1616 Microcontroller.  This AVR series 1 chip uses very little power and has fantastic capabilities and IO for its size. 
								However, the flash available is limited to 16kb. This is leaps and bounds better than its cousins like the ATTiny85 (2kb) or the ATTiny13 (1kb) but in order to get the most out of the badge, we have separated some of the story telling elements for the badge and hosted them here instead where we are not bound by the flash size limitations and can share a richer experience.</p>
								<p>As you progress through the adventure and solve challenges, you will enjoy a rich backstory / choose your own adventure and maybe even obtain a few codes that can be entered into 
								the serial interface on the badge to unlock features and help progress with the badge.</p>
